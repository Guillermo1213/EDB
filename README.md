# Eat-Da-Burger
If you can think of it, we can spell it! That's right, unlike the way this project was presented to me, I will explain that all we are doing is accepting a typed burger description and then eating or not! So.. what does that mean exactly? Check it out, it includes Handlebars/Express/MySQL all on the beauty that is Node.

Go ahead and enter any burger name that your heart desires! This will add the burger entry into the MySQL database. This will render it as being *ready* on the menu whilst placing it on the left. You can then devour the burger by clicking on it,this will move the burger to the right side and update it accordingly in the database.

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Using MySQL, open schema.sql from 'db' directory and run script to create database for application.
3. (Optional) If you'd like to insert some example values, I've included a seeds.sql file.
4. After creating database, navigate to the root folder of the repo and run `npm i` to install Node packages necassary for app to function.
5. Once packages have finished installing, you can begin running your server by typing `node server.js`
6. You can now go to your browser and visit: localhost:8080 to see the magic!
