# Eat-Da-Burger
If you can think of it, we can spell it! That's right, unlike the way this project was presented to me, I will explain that all we are doing is accepting a typed burger description and then eating or not! So.. what does that mean exactly? Check it out, it includes Handlebars/Express/MySQL all on the beauty that is Node.

Go ahead and enter any burger name that your heart desires! This will add the burger entry into the MySQL database. This will render it as being *ready* on the menu whilst placing it on the left. You can then devour the burger by clicking on it,this will move the burger to the right side and update it accordingly in the database.
